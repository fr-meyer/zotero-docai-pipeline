    """Decorator that retries a function with exponential backoff on failure.

    Implements exponential backoff retry logic with configurable parameters.
    The delay between retries follows the formula:
    delay = min(initial_delay * (backoff_multiplier ** (attempt - 1)), max_delay)

    Args:
        max_attempts: Maximum number of attempts (including the first attempt).
            Must be at least 1.
        initial_delay: Initial delay in seconds before the first retry.
            Must be greater than 0.
        backoff_multiplier: Multiplier for exponential backoff. Each retry delay
            is multiplied by this factor. Must be greater than 0.
        max_delay: Maximum delay cap in seconds. Prevents delays from growing
            too large. Must be greater than or equal to initial_delay.
        exceptions: Tuple of exception types to catch and retry on. Defaults to
            (Exception,) to catch all exceptions. Only exceptions of these types
            (or their subclasses) will trigger retries.
        on_retry: Optional callback function called before each retry attempt.
            Receives three arguments: attempt number (1-indexed), delay in seconds,
            and the exception that triggered the retry. Useful for logging or
            context-aware retry handling. If the callback raises an exception,
            it will propagate and stop the retry loop.

    Returns:
        Decorator function that wraps the target function with retry logic.

    Raises:
        The last exception raised by the decorated function if all attempts fail.
        Any exception raised by the on_retry callback will propagate immediately.

    Example:
        Basic usage with default exception handling:

        >>> @retry_with_backoff(
        ...     max_attempts=3,
        ...     initial_delay=2.0,
        ...     backoff_multiplier=2.0,
        ...     max_delay=16.0
        ... )
        ... def fetch_data():
        ...     return requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")

        Usage with specific exception types and retry callback:

        >>> def log_retry(attempt: int, delay: float, exception: Exception):
        ...     logger.info(f"Retry attempt {attempt} after {delay}s: {exception}")

        >>> @retry_with_backoff(
        ...     max_attempts=3,
        ...     initial_delay=2.0,
        ...     backoff_multiplier=2.0,
        ...     max_delay=16.0,
        ...     exceptions=(requests.RequestException, URLError),
        ...     on_retry=log_retry
        ... )
        ... def download_file(url: str):
        ...     return requests.get(url)

        Usage with function arguments:

        >>> @retry_with_backoff(
        ...     max_attempts=5,
        ...     initial_delay=1.0,
        ...     backoff_multiplier=1.5,
        ...     max_delay=10.0
        ... )
        ... def process_item(item_id: str, timeout: int = 30):
        ...     return api_client.process(item_id, timeout=timeout)
