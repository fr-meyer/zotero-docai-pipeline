"""
Tree structure processor for extracting and persisting document tree structures.

This module provides the TreeStructureProcessor class, which acts as a high-level
orchestrator for tree structure operations. The processor uses dependency injection
to receive a TreeClient instance, enabling provider-agnostic tree extraction. It
provides three core methods: extracting trees from OCR results, processing markdown
to trees, and saving trees to disk as JSON.

The processor follows the same patterns as existing domain services, using
comprehensive logging, graceful error handling, and returning domain models. The
save_to_disk method integrates with the existing pipeline disk persistence pattern,
creating JSON files in the format {item_dir}/{pdf_name}_tree_structure.json.

Example usage:
    >>> from zotero_docai_pipeline.clients.pageindex_tree_client import (
    ...     PageIndexTreeClient
    ... )
    >>> from zotero_docai_pipeline.domain.config import TreeStructureConfig
    >>> from zotero_docai_pipeline.domain.tree_processor import TreeStructureProcessor
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize processor with tree client
    >>> config = TreeStructureConfig(summary=True, text=False, description=True)
    >>> client = PageIndexTreeClient(config, "https://api.pageindex.ai", "api-key")
    >>> processor = TreeStructureProcessor(client)
    >>>
    >>> # Extract tree from processed OCR document
    >>> tree = processor.extract_from_ocr_result("doc-123")
    >>>
    >>> # Process markdown to tree structure
    >>> tree = processor.process_from_markdown(markdown_content, "document.md")
    >>>
    >>> # Save tree to disk
    >>> from pathlib import Path

class TreeStructureProcessor:
    """High-level orchestrator for tree structure extraction and persistence.

    This processor provides a unified interface for tree structure operations,
    abstracting away provider-specific details through dependency injection of
    a TreeClient implementation. The processor handles tree extraction from
    OCR results, markdown-to-tree conversion, and disk persistence as JSON files.

    The processor follows the same architectural patterns as other domain services,
    using comprehensive logging, graceful error handling, and returning domain models.
    Tree extraction errors are re-raised to allow callers to handle them, while disk
    save errors are logged but not raised (disk persistence is optional).

    Attributes:
        tree_client: TreeClient instance used for tree extraction operations.
            Any TreeClient implementation can be injected (PageIndex, future providers).
        logger: Logger instance for this processor, scoped to the module name.
